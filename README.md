---

## Quick Start (5 steps to go live)

### Step 1 — Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pickmypath.git
cd pickmypath
npm install
```

### Step 2 — Set up Supabase (free)
1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a free account
2. Create a new project (choose a region close to South Africa — e.g. eu-west-1)
3. Go to **SQL Editor** → **New Query** → paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` → click **Run**
4. Go to **Settings → API** and copy:
   - Project URL → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `anon` public key → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `service_role` secret key → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Step 3 — Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
Open `.env.local` and fill in all values. See comments in the file for where to get each one.

**Minimum required to run locally:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (from https://console.anthropic.com)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (choose anything for local testing)
- `JWT_SECRET` (generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)

### Step 4 — Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

**PayFast is in sandbox mode by default** — you can complete the full flow without a real PayFast account. Payment will be skipped automatically.

### Step 5 — Deploy to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub (the `.env.local` file is in `.gitignore` — it will NOT be pushed)
2. Go to https://vercel.com → Import your GitHub repo
3. In Vercel's project settings → **Environment Variables** → add all variables from `.env.local`
4. Deploy!
